<p class="main">So, here's where I'm starting out with the HTML and CSS I just learned.</p>
<p class="sidebar">Many thanks to CodeCademy, BTW.</p>
<p class="main">I'm hoping I can use this format to show my abilities in coding, web page making, and maybe 
even writing... if I could think of anything.</p>
<p class="main">In the meantime, some fancy CSS &amp; jQuery stuff:</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Computer Systems Programmer II at Desert Research Institute, 1999-2016</p>
<p>As the computer support for several research papers, I was the one who worked with data, put together charts and graphs, and occasionally put together scripts and even programs to help with the work.</p>
<p>As part of the job, I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux &amp; Solaris system administration, including installation and updates</li>
<li>MATLAB installing, programming and teaching</li>
<li>C programming</li>
<li>Perl programming</li>
<li>Python programming</li>
<li>Bash and csh shell scripts</li>
<li>Configuration and education</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, after losing some personnel and a slump in getting projects, my position was eliminated. (In fact, I believe the entire group is gone.)</p>

<div class="talkText">A job using my skills&mdash;DevOps using C, C++, Perl, or Python; or, Linux system administration. I'm looking for a local job&mdash;presumably an office job&mdash;but I would be open to a remote job. (Especially considering, for all the growing Reno is doing, it's still not yet much of a tech hub&hellip;)</div>
