<p class="main">Hi, my name is Travis McCord, and I need your help getting a job.</p>
<p class="main">I've been unemployed for over a year now, despite having worked with computers for more than twenty years. Possibly because the computers I worked with (on a professional basis) were Linux machines. My old job was at a research facility&mdash;part of the local university system, in fact&mdash;where I would set up and run simulations on our supercomputer, set up and maintain Linux workstations for professors and grad students, put together scripts to check and sort through data, and occasionally do some higher-level programming, such as the <em class="color">Lagrangian Particle Model</em> I mention in my resume.</p>
<p class="sidebar">Quick explanation: that was a program that could take a weather forecast and data about fires or smokestacks and tell you where the smoke plume is likely to go. It started out as a non-working Fortran program, but I was able to transform it into a working C program&mdash;C because it could run on more machines without needing an expensive compiler&mdash;and tweaked it over the years to fix problems and add features. Our group used it for a few academic papers, and at one point they went and had it patented, I think.</p>
<p class="main">Unfortunately, back in June of last year a combination of personnel attrition (including our group's leader going back to his home country) and the slump in government projects that comes with every election year meant my job went away. I immediately ran into the same problem I had back in 1991 when I graduated with my BSCS: the degree doesn't really include skills to get employment <em>here</em>. <em class="color">The tech industry in Reno is primarily companies that make video poker and video slot machines.</em></p>
<p class="sidebar">We are getting high-tech moving in&mdash;including Tesla&mdash;but they're not established enough to need Linux guys yet, if they're even going in that direction.</p>
<p class="main">Of course, when I was let go I put word out on the usual websites&hellip; Monster, Dice, Glassdoor, CareerBuilder, et cetera.  In fact, I get about sixty emails a day from those places&hellip; though it should tell you something about the job situation here that most of them have ads for Lyft or Uber drivers, warehouse positions, and the like, even when they have my resume and skills.</p>
<p class="main">The positions that are more in tune with my would-be career path seem to have a talent for picking the skills I don't have, such as C# and Java. Technically I know a lot of those languages since they're derived from C, but since we didn't actually use them where I worked even if I learn them I'm not "experienced" with them. Lately I've been adding new skills via piles of books and sites like CodeCademy&mdash;starting with things like HTML/CSS, PHP, and jQuery, since those are relatively easy to start with&mdash;but since I'm just starting out with many of those skills I'm not sure how much expertise to say I have.</p> 
<p class="main">The biggest problem is that I've been resistant to leaving Reno. After all, my friends and family are here. Unfortunately, jobs are, well, <em style="color: FireBrick;">there</em>&hellip; I think.</p>
<p class="sidebar">For many, many instances of "there" that are "not here".</p>
<p class="main">That said, I have thought about moving to the Sacramento area or the Bay area&hellip; but I don't know if the skills I have would actually translate to employment there.</p>
<p class="sidebar">Especially considering the cost of living in the Bay area.</p>
<p class="main">So, what I'm asking is, what should I do? Any particular skill I should be focusing on learning? Should I keep staying here, or move to where jobs are?</p>
<p class="main">I've been reluctant to ask for help because, after all, it is a flagrant violation of the Guy Code, and I could wind up forfeiting my ceremonial lug wrench. But it's been more than a year now. I could continue on my savings for a little while, but I'd much rather work.</p>
